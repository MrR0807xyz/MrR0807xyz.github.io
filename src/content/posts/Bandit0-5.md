## Level 5: File types, specifically human-readable files.



GOAL The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.



SOLUTION



  `





```bash

$ ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

inhere

bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere/

bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls

-file00  -file01  -file02  -file03  -file04  -file05  -file06  -file07  -file08  -file09

bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file00

/`2ғ%rL~5gbandit4@bandit:~/inhere$



```

`



We get some weird data when we try to read the file, lets list the type of every file with the command file



  `





```bash

bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ file ./*

./-file00: data

./-file01: data

./-file02: data

./-file03: data
